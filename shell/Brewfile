# This handles installing software using Homebrew via it's built-in `brew bundle` command.
# For more information on how to write a `Brewfile` file, check out the following page:
# https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle?tab=readme-ov-file

# At a high-level:
#
# - A `formula` is what is generally available via `brew install`.
# - A `cask` is an application distributed in binary form (e.g. Firefox, Alacritty, etc).
# - A `tap` is a git repo containing multiple formulae/casks
# 
# As a general rule of thumb, setup taps first so that you can then access
# formulae/casks that might not be available otherwise.
#
